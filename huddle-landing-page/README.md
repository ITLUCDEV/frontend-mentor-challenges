### What I learned

Creating a landing page through the design provided by Frontend Mentor was a great learning experience for me. Using HTML5, CSS3, and SASS, I was able to structure and style a web page effectively and in an organized manner.

Following the provided design, I gained an understanding of how to apply web design concepts in practice, such as the importance of visual hierarchy, color, typography, and content organization.

In addition, using SASS, I learned how to utilize variables, and control structures to create reusable and maintainable styles. This can save me time and effort in future projects.

Overall, creating this landing page has provided me with valuable skills and knowledge that will serve me well as a web developer. I am proud to have completed the Frontend Mentor challenge and am excited to continue on my path in web development.
