## My process

I started by structuring all the content using HTML and then gradually incorporated design using CSS and Sass to style and enhance the appearance of the Product Preview Card component.

In particular, I used Flexbox and CSS Grid to organize the different elements and adjust their position and size on the page. As I progressed through the project, I experimented with different style combinations and adjusted properties to achieve the desired outcome.

Finally, I spent time editing the media query to try to fix some errors in the component's display on different screen sizes and devices. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding process that allowed me to improve my skills in web design and development.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS

### What I learned

During this project, I have improved my design skills and learned how to apply them to practice. However, I have found that I still have difficulties creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and resolutions.

Overall, this project has been an excellent opportunity to consolidate my HTML, CSS, and Sass skills, and to learn to work with different code components and structures. I am excited to continue improving and learning in future projects.
